# Dynamic-Web-Scraping
Dynamic Web Scraping using Python + Selenium Web Driver + BS4 

Python + BS4 are great for scraping static content however I needed to scrape dynamic content from multiple pages.
So I used Selenium Web Driver to reach each web page individually and scraped necessary content by using html & css tags.
Then I saved the scraped content to a csv file.

You need to change web page and necessary tags to make it usable for your case.
